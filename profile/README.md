# Open Cartography

Bridging the Worlds of Opentelemetry and Cartography
## Manifesto: 
_A Vision for a Connected, Empowered Future_

1. **Universal Access**: Let us dream of a world where everyone has the right to open-source topology maps, empowering them to identify and address problems efficiently, no matter their background or resources.
2. **Inclusive Benefits**: Envision an environment where organizations, both small and large, can harness the power of OpenTelemetry and equally reap its transformative benefits.
3. **Collective Intelligence**: Imagine the progress we can achieve by uniting diverse perspectives and experiences, creating powerful and insightful cartograms that drive innovation.
4. **Environmental Responsibility**: We pledge to protect our planet and future generations by reducing our carbon footprint and minimizing energy consumption in our pursuit of technological advancements.
5. **Embracing Collaboration**: Together, we can overcome challenges and unlock new opportunities in service topology mapping, fostering a more connected, equitable, and prosperous world.
6. **Shared Ownership**: Let us break free from the shackles of monopolies and ensure that topology mapping tools and resources are equally accessible and available to all, not controlled by any individual or company.
7. **Cutting-Edge Innovation**: We will relentlessly strive for state-of-the-art advancements in open-source service topology maps, pushing the boundaries of what is possible and setting new standards in the field.
8. **Intuitive and Accessible Visuals**: We envision a future where self-descriptive and intuitively designed topology maps enable everyone, regardless of their background, to identify problems and bottlenecks with ease, fostering informed decision-making for all.

Together, let us march towards this bright and empowered future, united by the vision of open cartography, where technology serves as a bridge to a more connected and enlightened world.
## Design Principles
_A Journey of Discovery and Understanding_

Open Cartography is a cutting-edge visualization tool that marries the rich traditions of cartography with the modern advancements of OpenTelemetry. Our goal is to design and create dynamic, temporal graph networks that offer users an unparalleled perspective on their data-driven systems.

Throughout history, cartography has been about more than map-making; it is the art and science of understanding and communicating spatial information. Cartographers have long guided humanity in navigating, exploring, and understanding the world around us, igniting a sense of adventure, curiosity, and discovery.

OpenTelemetry, on the other hand, represents the apex of modern data monitoring and observability. By collecting, analyzing, and correlating metrics, traces, and logs, it enables users to gain valuable insights into their systems' inner workings. This unprecedented visibility paves the way for informed decision-making, improved performance, and enhanced reliability.

Open Cartography brings together the best of both worlds, merging the historical and emotional resonance of cartography with the technical prowess of OpenTelemetry. Our solution empowers users to derive high-level pathways and visually create a behavioral design model of their systems, crafting a "human perceivable base map" that is both intuitive and informative. This fusion of art and science helps users better understand their systems' complex relationships, setting the stage for optimized performance and innovation.

Embrace the power of Open Cartography and embark on a new journey of discovery and understanding. Reveal the hidden connections within your system, delve into the intricacies of your data, and navigate your way to success with the unparalleled visualization capabilities of Open Cartography.
