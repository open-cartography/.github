### Desk Controller App:

- A Mac Status Bar application for controlling the IKEA IDÅSEN (Linak) Desk. [More info here](https://github.com/DWilliames/idasen-controller-mac)

### Trackpad:

- The best middle-ground option compared to trackpoints, mouses, and trackballs. However, thumbs could be better utilized in the future with dual trackballs, similar to joysticks. [More info here](https://www.apple.com/nl/shop/product/MMMP3Z/A/magic-trackpad-zwart-multi%E2%80%91touch-oppervlak)

### Trackpad Nest:

- A starting point in its evolution, 3D-printed from STL files available on GitHub. [More info here](https://github.com/Leask/Keyboard-Trackpad-Nest)

### Tray:

- Currently as light as possible and wide enough to fit over chair arms. While essential for now, the tray might become obsolete if the trackpad nest design evolves further. [More info here](https://www.bol.com/nl/nl/p/skote-laptopstandaard-flexibel-werken/9300000031524475/)

### Split Keyboard:

- Finally, a budget-friendly alternative to more expensive custom and Kinesis options.

### Deck Buttons:

- The buttons are configured to control various functions, from adjusting the desk height to switching applications, enhancing overall productivity. They're connected to the Mac via the Stream Deck Mobile application and extend functionality through AppleScript plugins.

### Chair:

- The best seat in the house, especially when paired with my mobile cockpit setup. [More info here](https://www.varierfurniture.com/en/gravity)

### All 4 One:

- Let's ride: this setup isn't just a workspace, it's a cockpit for innovation, comfort, and ultimate productivity.
